Easy:

create variables for the word, the hidden word and the number of incorrect guesses
create an input where the user is asked to guess a letter, and the letter is stored
you can use a while loop to make sure that the user is always asked to guess another letter until the word is finished/incorrect guesses reached

iterate through the word(for i in range) and check if the letter is correct by using word[i]==letter
strings in python are immutable, meaning you cant do hiddenword[i]=letter to replace a hyphen/dash
A good way to approach this problem is to use hiddenword as a list, which is mutable, and then convert it to a string when displaying the hidden word to the user
you can convert a list to a string by iterating through the list, and adding each item to a string which starts of empty, e.g. string+=item

You will need to break the loop either if the word has been completed, or if the user has made 7 incorrect guesses.
A function can be ended by typing return  and a loop can be broken by typing break

Medium:

the best way to implement the ASCII art would be to have all of the ASCII drawings in a list.
Conveniently there are eight drawings, and so they would work for 0-7 incorrect guesses.
Using print(list[incorrectguesses]) will then give you the right one

In order to have dashes and spaces in the hidden list, the easiest way is to use the method above in the easy section with the hidden word as a list

Hard:

this part of the challenge will only work if run from the computer terminal.

the command sys.stdout.write("\033[F")  will move the printing cursor to the previous line
the command sys.stdout.write("\033[K")  will then clear the rest of the line
this will allow you to overwrite all previous text if you use the commands a certain number of times, and have your print statements in the right order

in order to use these commands, paste these lines into the start of your code:

import sys
import ctypes
kernel32 = ctypes.windll.kernel32
kernel32.SetConsoleMode(kernel32.GetStdHandle(-11), 7)

this method only works for windows 10 i believe. There are very similar solutions but with different syntax for other OSs
